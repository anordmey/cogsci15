\begin{abstract}
Why are negative sentences processed faster in some contexts than in others?  Previous work suggests that the effects of context on negative sentence processing are due to the informativeness of negation in context \cite{nordmeyer2014}.  We explored how adults' explicit felicity judgments changed depending on the context in which a negative sentence was presented.  In Study 1, we found that negative sentences were rated as more felicitous when they were presented within a strong context compared to a weak context, and that negative sentences expressing nonexistence were rated higher than negative sentences that referred to an alternative object.  In Study 2, we found that negative sentences referring to an alternative characteristic were rated higher when they were presented in a context where all of the other characters possessed the negated object, compared to contexts where the other characters possessed the alternative object or no object.  Finally, we compared these data to a model of the informativeness of sentences in context, and found that this model reflected the same pattern as adults' ratings for true negative sentences in our experiments.  Our data suggest that the felicity of negative sentences may be influenced by their informativeness in context.

\section{Introduction}

% An important aspect of human communication is how speakers use language and how listeners interpret their intended meaning.  

A sentence that is both grammatical and true can nevertheless sound odd in some contexts. If you open a mysterious box and find that it is empty, it's weird to say ``This box doesn't have any chocolates in it,'' despite the truth of the proposition. But the same sentence becomes perfectly reasonable if you are in a chocolate store surrounded by boxes filled with chocolate.  Why do some sentences sound strange (\emph{infelicitous}) in one situation, but normal in another?

Theories of pragmatics attempt to provide an account of how language users move from the literal semantics of a sentence to an inference about the speaker's intended meaning in context. For example, according to Grice's \citeyear{grice1975} Cooperative Principle, speakers should produce utterances that are truthful, relevant, and informative, and by assuming that speakers do so, listeners can make inferences about intended meaning that are stronger than the sentence's literal meaning. Modern neo-Gricean theories tend to derive such inferences from the tension between attempting to be informative with respect to a communicative goal while minimizing the effort expended \cite{horn1984,levinson2000,frank2012}. These theories make predictions about sentence felicity: As in our example above, even when a sentence is both grammatical and true, if it is not pragmatically optimal, it can sound strange. 

We explore this relationship between contextual pragmatics and felicity using negation. As the previous example demonstrates, negative sentences are particularly sensitive to to effects of context, making them a good case study.  When they are presented without any context, negative sentences are difficult to process compared with positive sentences \cite{hclark1972, carpenter1975, just1971, just1976}, but supportive contexts can substantially reduce this processing difficulty \cite{wason1965, glenberg1999, ludtke2006, nieuwland2008, dale2011, nordmeyer2014b}.  
% -- specifically, context that sets up an expectation that is violated -- the

The context of a negative sentence can also influence the type of negation that the sentence expresses.  Most of the previous work on adults' comprehension of negative sentences has focused on denial, or truth-functional negation -- that is, negative sentences expressing that some proposition is false.  This is not the only function of negation, however; negative sentences can be used to express nonexistence, refusal, and prohibition, among many others \cite<see>{choi1988}.  Here, we focus \emph{alternative} negation and \emph{nonexistence} negation,
% ((NOTE: I am getting a little bogged down by terminology in this paper -- starting here, but especially when I start describing different conditions later.   Any suggestions??))
which can both be expressed with the same sentence depending on the context.  Referring to our previous example, the sentence ``This box doesn't contain chocolate'' might referring to the fact that the box is empty (conveying nonexistence), but it could be referring to the fact that the box contains some alternative object (e.g. the box contains broccoli, not chocolate!).  

Much of the literature on how people use different types of negation has focused on children's production of negation \cite{bloom1970, pea1980, choi1988}.  In one study, children in an eye-tracking study heard sentences such as ``Look at the boy who has no apples'', where the target of the sentence was either a character with nothing (negation-as-nonexistence) or a character with some other object (negation-as-alternative) \cite{nordmeyer2013, nordmeyer2014b}.  Children had more difficulty identifying the referent of the negative sentence when the negation referred to nonexistence, possibly due to the task demands involved in orienting away from a more engaging picture.  Adults, however, were marginally faster to orient towards the correct picture in the negation-as-nonexistence condition compared to the negation-as-alternative condition.  This suggests that adults are sensitive to this difference, but it is not clear if this is due to differences in processing demands (e.g. adults may have found it easier than children to identify a character with nothing, compared to a character with a different object), or if this reflects an expectation that adults have about how negation should be used in different contexts.  Adults' may have found the negative sentences infelicitous in the negation-as-alternative context, because they expected the sentence to describe the feature that the character \emph{had}, rather than a feature that they did \emph{not} have.


SHARPEN MOTIVATING QUESTION Why might different contexts influence the processing of negation?  In previous work, we demonstrated that negative sentences are more informative in contexts that set up a strong expectation that is violated, and that this difference in informativeness can predict adults' reaction times to respond to negative vs. positive sentences \cite{nordmeyer2014}.  

In the current work, we explore the effects of context on adults' explicit felicity judgments for different types of negative sentences.  In Study 1, we test the effect of a strong vs. a weak context on two different types of negative sentences: negation-as-nonexistence and negation-as-alternative.  We also tested two different negative sentence frames: ``has no'' and ``doesn't have.''  We found that negative sentences presented in a strong context were rated higher than negative sentences in a weak context, and that negation-as-nonexistence sentences were rated higher than negation-as-alternative sentences.  In Study 2, we focused on negation-as-alternative trials to further explore how context influences the felicity of these sentences.  We found that these sentences are rated higher when they were presented in a context where all of the other characters possessed the negated object, compared to contexts where the other characters possessed the alternative object or no object.  Finally, we found that a model of the informativeness of sentences in context predicted the same qualitative pattern seen in our data, suggesting that adults' felicity judgments reflect preferences for sentences that are more informative given the context.

\section{Experiment 1}

Experiment 1 explored how different contexts affected participants felicity ratings for negative sentences.  Half of the participants in Experiment 1 saw sentences presented within a weak context (one where none of the characters had any objects), and the other half saw sentences presented within a strong context (one where everyone in the context possessed the negated object).  Previous work has found that this context manipulation improves adults' processing of negative sentences \cite{nordmeyer2014}; here we test whether context changes explicit felicity judgments as well.  

We also tested two within-subjects factors that might influence negative sentence ratings.  First, we looked at how different syntactic framings might influence sentence judgments.  In our previous work on the effects of context on reaction time, we tested sentences such as ``X has no Y.''  In this experiment, we also tested sentential negation, using sentences such as ``X doesn't have Y.''  We were interested in whether participants had a preference for one framing over another, and whether this would interact with context.  If previously seen context effects are driven by the informativeness of negation in different contexts, then these same effects should appear regardless of the syntactic framing of the sentences.  

Finally, we examined whether the type of negation influenced felicity.  In half of the true negative trials, the referent of the negative sentence was a character who had nothing.  In these sentences, the negation refers to the \emph{nonexistence} of the named item.  In the other half of true negative trials, the referent of the sentence was a character who had some other object.  In these sentences, the negation refers to the fact that the character has an \emph{alternative} object.  Previous work suggests that children and adults show different gaze patterns in response to these different types of negative sentences \cite{nordmeyer2014b}; here we explore whether adults' have a preference for the type of negation expressed in different negative sentences.

\subsection{Method}

\subsubsection{Participants}

We recruited 94 participants to participate in an online experiment through Amazon Mechanical Turk.  Participants ranged in age from 18-65; 50 were male and 41 female (3 declined to report gender).  We restricted participation to individuals in the United States. We paid 35 cents for the experiment, which took approximately 5 minutes to complete.  

\subsubsection{Stimuli}

We created 16 trial items. On each trial, four different Sesame Street characters were shown standing behind tables.  One character was randomly selected as the ``target'' character, designated by a red box around that character and the character's table, and the remaining three characters were designated as ``context'' characters.

Participants were randomly assigned to the ``no context'' condition or the ``context'' condition.  In the no context condition, the context characters all stood behind empty tables.  In the context condition, each context character had identical objects on their tables (``target objects'').  The objects belonged to one of four categories: animals (cat, dog, horse cow), vehicles (car, bus, boat, truck), food (apple, banana, cookie, orange), and household objects (fork, spoon, bowl, plate).  

Below the characters was a sentence about the target character.  Six of these sentences were positive sentences of the form ``[CHARACTER] has a/an [TARGET OBJECT].''  Five were negative sentences of the form ``[CHARACTER] has no [TARGET OBJECT]'' and five were negative sentences of the form ``[CHARACTER] doesn't have a/an [TARGET OBJECT]''.  

The target character either had a target object on their table, or an alternative object (``alternative'' trials), or nothing (``nonexistence'' trials).  This allowed us to examine two different negative concepts (``alternative'' and ``nonexistence'').  These trial conditions were crossed such that each participant saw six true positive trials, two false positive trials (one alternative and one nonexistence), two false negative trials (one ``has no'' sentence type and one ``doesn't have'' sentence type), and eight true negative trials (two ``has no''/nonexistence, two ``has no''/alternative, two ``doesn't have/nonexistence'', and two ``doesn't have/alternative'').  Each of these trial types was randomly assigned to a target object, and trials were presented in a random order.

A slider bar was positioned beneath the sentence, with a 7 point scale ranging from ``Very Bad'' to ``Very Good.''  A progress bar at the top of the screen informed participants how much of the experiment they had completed.

% \vspace{-5mm}
\end{center} 
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Procedure}

Participants were first presented with an instructions screen that briefly described the task and informed them that they could stop at any time.  Once participants had agreed to participate in the task, they saw an instructions screen that explained the task in more detail.  The instructions explained that participants would see a sentence, and that this sentence was about the character in the red square.  Participants were told that their job was to rate how ``good'' each sentence is, and ``if no one would ever say a particular sentence in this context, or if it is just wrong, rank that as `Very Bad', but if something is right and sounds perfectly normal, mark it as `Very Good'.''  Participants were encouraged to use the entire scale to make their ratings.

On each trial the pictures, sentence, and slider bar appeared simultaneously, and participants had to make a selection on the sliding scale in order to progress to the next trial.  

\subsubsection{Data Processing}

We excluded from analysis two participants who did not list English as their native language, and eight participants for using fewer than 3 points on the scale.  Thus, data from a total of 84 participants were analyzed, 46 in the no context condition and 38 in the context condition.  

\subsection{Results and Discussion}

\subsubsection{Effects of context}

True negative sentences were rated significantly higher when they were presented in a strong context compared to a weak context (Figure \ref{fig:s1}). For example, the sentence ``Abby has no apples'' was rated higher when all of the other characters \emph{had} apples, compared to contexts where all of the other characters had nothing. This finding supports our hypotheses and previous research on the effects of context on negation, replicating previous processing-time effects using explicit felicity judgments.  True positive sentences did not show any effect of context, nor did false sentences of any sentence type, likely due to a ceiling effect for true positive sentences and a floor effect for false sentences.  

We ran a linear mixed-effects model testing the interaction between context, sentence type, and truth value on participant sentence ratings.\footnote{All mixed-effects models were fit using the lme4 package in R version 2.15.3.  The model specification was as follows: \texttt{rating $\sim$ context~$\times$~sentence~$\times$~truth + (sentence~$\times$~truth~\textbar~subject) +  (sentence~$\times$~truth~\textbar~item)}  Significance was calculated using the standard normal approximation to the $t$ distribution \cite{barr2013}. Data and analysis code can be found at \href{http://github.com/anordmey/FILLTHISIN}{http://github.com/anordmey/FILLTHISIN}}.  Results of this model showed a main effect of sentence type, with negative sentences receiving significantly lower ratings than positive sentences ($\beta= -.58$, $p< .01$), and a main effect of truth value, with false sentences scoring approximately four points lower on the 7-point scale compared to true sentences ($\beta= 4.19$, $p< .001$).  There was not a main effect of context ($\beta= -0.52$, $p=.12$), but there was a significant interaction between sentence type and context, with negative sentences scoring significantly higher when presented in a strong context compared to a weak context ($\beta= 2.04$, $p< .05$).  


\subsubsection{Effects of negation type and sentence type}

Negative sentences expressing nonexistence were rated as more felicitous than negative sentences that referred to an alternative object, and sentences with the framing ``doesn't have'' were rated higher than sentences with the framing ``has no''.  These effects persisted regardless of whether the sentence was presented in a weak context or a strong context (see Figure \ref{fig:s1}).  

To test the reliability of these findings, we fit a linear mixed-effects model to sentence ratings for responses to true negative sentences only.  Coefficients for this model can be seen in Table \ref{tab:s1}.  We examined the interaction between context, negation type (e.g. nonexistence or alternative), and negation framing (e.g. ``has no X'' vs ``doesn't have X'').\footnote{ The model specification was as follows: \texttt{rating $\sim$ context~$\times$~negation type~$\times$~negation type + (negation type~$\times$~negation frame~\textbar~subject) +  (negation type~$\times$~negation frame~\textbar~item)}} We found a main effect of context, with true negative sentences presented in a strong context eliciting significantly higher ratings than true negative sentences presented in a weak context ($\beta= .99$, $p< .001$).  We also found main effects of negation type, with sentences referring to an alternative receiving lower ratings than sentences expressing nonexistence ($\beta= -.46$, $p< .05$), as well as negation framing, with sentences of the form ``has no X'' receiving lower ratings than sentences of the form ``doesn't have X''  ($\beta= -.46$, $p< .05$).  There were no interactions between negation frame, negation type, and context.  

The difference between the two negation sentence frames is likely due to frequency effects in the input (GET SOME DATA). 

Our previous eye-tracking work found that adults were somewhat faster to look at the target in situations with nonexistence negation, compared with alternative negation \cite{nordmeyer2014b}. In that experiment, however, this difference could have arisen because of superficial, stimulus-level differences, since it might be easier to identify a character with nothing than one with an alternative object. Our replication of this result here using explicit felicity judgment suggests that this difference in eye-movements might have resulted from pragmatic factors as well. 

One explanation for this finding is that a negative sentence such as ``Abby doesn't have an apple'' is more informative when Abby has nothing compared to when she has an alternative object.  In a strong context (e.g. one where everyone besides Abby has apples), using negation to point out Abby's lack of apples is informative, because it uniquely identifies her character in the array.  When Abby has some alternative object (e.g. a cat), however, there is a \emph{more} informative utterance that a speaker could use (e.g. ``Abby has a cat'').  The presence of a more informative utterance makes these negative sentences less felicitous, even when they appear in a strong context.

\section{Experiment 2}

Experiment 1 found clear differences in participants' ratings of negative sentences.  Participants preferred negative sentences with the sentential framing ``doesn't have X'' compared to the lexical framing ``has no X.''  Participants also preferred negative sentences that referred to nonexistence.  Across both of these factors, negative sentences that were presented within a strong context (where all context characters possessed the negated object) received higher ratings than negative sentences presented in a weak context, where none of the characters in the context possessed any object.

In our next experiment, we further explored this context effect by focusing specifically on alternative negation sentences with a ``doesn't have'' framing.  In Experiment 2, we made context a within-subjects factor, so that participants saw multiple items of different context types throughout the experiment.  We examined the effect of three different types of context: a ``target'' context, in which all context characters had the negated target object (identical to the strong context in Experiment 1), a ``none'' context, in which none of the context characters had any objects (identical to the weak context in Experiment 1), and a ``foil'' context, in which all context characters had an alternative object (e.g. a different object than the one negated in the negative sentences). 

We expected to replicate the same difference between the none context and the target context as was seen in Experiment 1: Negative sentences presented in a target context should receive higher ratings than negative sentences presented in a none context.  We had two competing predictions about the foil context.
% ((NOTE: I actually didn't articulate this until after running the experiments, but I think it works as a possible alternative hypothesis.  Is it OK to set this up like this))).  
In true negative trials with a foil context, all characters (including the target character) had the same objects on their table (e.g. cats), and the negative sentence referred to a different object (e.g. ``X doesn't have apples'').  Some previous work has suggested that a critical element of the effect of context on negative sentences is the fact that the referent of the negative sentence is the ``odd one out'' \cite{wason1965}.  If this is the case, the foil context might be even worse than the none context, because the target of the negative sentence does not stand out from the context.  If, however, context changes the informativeness of negation, then there should be no difference between the foil and none contexts, because negative sentences are no less informative in the foil context.  

\subsection{Method}

\subsubsection{Participants}

We recruited 194 participants to participate in an online experiment through Amazon Mechanical Turk.  Participants ranged in age from 18-65; 115 were male and 76 female (3 declined to report gender).  We restricted participation to individuals in the United States. We paid participants 40 cents and the experiment took approximately 7 minutes to complete.  

\subsubsection{Stimuli}

Trials in Experiment 2 had the same structure as trials in Experiment 1, with a small set of exceptions. First, there were 24 trials. Second, all negative sentences were of the form ``[CHARACTER] doesn't have a/an [TARGET OBJECT].'' Third, on each trial, the target character either had a target item on their table, or had an alternative item (eliminating the nonexistence trials).  Finally, each participant evaluated nine true positive sentences, three false positive, three false negative, and nine true negative trials.

In Experiment 2, context was a within-subjects factor with three levels. Trials either had ``no context,'' in which context characters had nothing on their table, identical to the no context condition in Experiment 1; a ``target context,'' in which context characters each had a target item on their table, same as the context condition in Experiment 1; or a ``foil context,'' in which context characters had an alternative item on their table (e.g., all characters have cat but the sentence is about the presence/absence of apples).  Each context condition appeared an equal number of times within each trial type.  


\subsubsection{Procedure}

The procedure was identical to Experiment 1.

\subsubsection{Data Processing}

We excluded from our analysis four participants who did not list English as their native language, six participants for having participated in a previous pilot study, and 34 participants for using fewer than 3 points on the scale.  Thus, data from a total of 154 participants were analyzed.  

\subsection{Results and Discussion}

True negative sentences were rated significantly higher when they were presented in a strong target context compared to either the none context or the foil context (Figure \ref{fig:modelvdata}).  Negative sentences presented in a foil context received a very small increase in ratings compared to negative sentences presented in a none context. As in Experiment 1, there was no effect of context on true positive sentences or false sentences.  


 % ((NOTE: I'm in a weird position here where it REALLY does not look like there is a significant difference here (I actually initially wrote that there WASN'T a difference), but it does show up as marginally significant in my data (and actually significant if I run a model on just the true sentences, which I don't report here but did on my own).  So I feel weird describing this as an actual difference in this first paragraph, but it does show up in my data -- and also in my model -- so I feel like I should?))).  

We fit a linear mixed-effects model to sentence ratings to test the interaction between context, sentence type, and truth value (Table \ref{tab:s2}).\footnote{ The model specification was as follows: \texttt{rating $\sim$ context~$\times$~sentence type~$\times$~truth value + (sentence type~$\times$~truth value~\textbar~subject) +  (sentence type~$\times$~truth value~\textbar~item)}}  We found a significant effect of truth value, with true sentences receiving significantly higher ratings than false sentences, ($\beta= 5.01$, $p< .001$).  A significant interaction between sentence type and truth value indicates that true negative sentences received lower ratings than true positive sentences, ($\beta= -1.78$, $p< .001$).  Finally, a three-way interaction between between sentence type, truth value, and context was significant for the target context ($\beta= 1.08$, $p< .001$), and marginally significant for the foil context ($\beta= .34$, $p=.06$), indicating that true negative sentences received significantly higher ratings in the target context compared to the none context, and slightly higher ratings in the foil context compared to the none context.

DISCUSSION HERE


\section{Model}

% Studies 1 and 2 explored the effects of context on different types of negative sentences.  
Both of the preceding studies found a significant effect of context on participants' ratings of true negative sentences.  Why does context have this effect on negative sentences?  One hypothesis is that felicity ratings are influenced by the \emph{informativeness} of negative sentences. On theories of pragmatics, speakers should produce sentences that are appropriately informative based on the context, and in a context where most characters have apples and another character has a cat, it is informative to mention the ``odd character out'' by describing the cat, because this feature is unique to the character being described.

% Previous work suggests that a probabilistic formalization of Gricean pragmatics \cite{frank2012} could predict adults' speed to evaluate negative sentences \cite{nordmeyer2014a}.  Here, we use the same model to explore whether participants' felicity judgments reflect a preference for sentences that are more informative based on the context.  


% We focus on true negative sentences here, because the ceiling effect for true positive sentences and the floor effect for negative sentences make it difficult to consider the effect of context on these sentences.  

We used a recent probabilistic model of pragmatics to make predictions about participants' felicity ratings, testing this hypothesis. Details of this model---the ``rational speech act'' model of pragmatics---can be found in a number of previous publications \cite{frank2012,goodman2013,nordmeyer2014a}. Here we give a brief sketch of the intuitions behind the model. The probability of a speaker making an utterance in context is defined as being  proportional to the informativeness of the word in context minus its cost.  Informativeness in context is calculated as the number of bits of information conveyed by the utterance.  We assume that the utterance has a uniform probability distribution over its extension in context (e.g., ``doesn't have apples'' applies to any character who does not have apples, leading to a uniform probability of picking out each individual character with apples). We defined cost as the number of words in the utterance multiplied by a cost-per-word parameter; in our simulations, we did not differentiate between different negative sentence frames, and treat negative sentences as having one word more than positive sentences.  Probabilities were normalized over a sparse vocabulary of possible positive or negative utterances that could be used to describe the characters.

\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{center} 
\includegraphics[width=3.25in]{figures/modelcomp.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:modelvdata} CAPTION HERE.}
\end{center} 
\end{figure}

Our model predicted the same qualitative pattern as the data from participants' sentence ratings (Figure \ref{fig:modelvdata}).  Sentences presented in a target context were preferred over sentences presented in a none context, because true negative utterances are more informative when everyone in the context possesses the negated object (e.g., the sentence ``Abby doesn't have apples'' uniquely identifies Abby when every other character \emph{does} have apples).  Nonexistence negation was assigned higher probability than alternative negation, because alternative negation could be described by an equally informative---and less costly---positive utterance (e.g., ``Abby has cats'' instead of ``Abby doesn't have apples'').  Thus, participants' sentence ratings appear to parallel the informativeness of sentences in context.  

% ((NOTE: I'm not sure how much of a big deal I want to make about this last section, and our predictions about informativeness being the driving force behind these data in general.  I'm wondering about this throughout my paper (e.g. do I want to take a strong stance on this at the beginning?  In the title?) and in particular I'm wondering how much I should focus on this in the general discussion)))
